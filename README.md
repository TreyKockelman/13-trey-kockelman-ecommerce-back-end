# Trey Kockelman 13 Ecommerce Back End

  
  ## Description
  This project is the back end development and setting up the routes for the back end of an ecommerce website. There were many challenges for this including the testing of the routes. Sometimes a single typo was the issue in getting the routes to work properly and the troubleshooting for that wasn't very effective. Other challenges included working with starter code that was given and working with that in tandem with my own code to make it work.
